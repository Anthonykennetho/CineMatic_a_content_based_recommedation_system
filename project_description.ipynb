    "# Nollywood Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚≠êÔ∏è Project Overview\n",
    "We developed a **Content-Based Recommendation System** specifically for promoting **Nigerian-made (Nollywood)** and **African-produced** movies. The system leverages movie metadata such as **genres, popularity, vote average, and release year** to recommend similar African films based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ STAR Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ **Situation**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of online streaming platforms like Netflix and iROKOtv, users expect personalized movie recommendations that match their tastes. For a **Nollywood-focused streaming platform**, we wanted to replicate the Netflix recommendation style using **content-based filtering**, tailored exclusively to **African-produced movies** sourced from **The Movie Database (TMDB)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ **Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective was to:\n",
    "1. Collect and clean metadata of **Nigerian** and **African** movies using the TMDB API.\n",
    "2. Engineer features such as genres, popularity, ratings, and release dates for recommendation.\n",
    "3. Build a content-based recommendation model that provides similar movie suggestions.\n",
    "4. Create an interactive user interface for seamless recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ **Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection:**\n",
    "- Used the TMDB API to fetch movie data across multiple categories:\n",
    "    - Popular Movies\n",
    "    - Top-Rated Movies\n",
    "    - Upcoming Movies\n",
    "    - Now Playing Movies\n",
    "- Filtered movies to include only those with **African production countries**, including Nigeria (NG), Ghana (GH), South Africa (ZA), Kenya (KE), and Egypt (EG).\n",
    "- Merged these filtered datasets into a unified DataFrame and removed duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "- Mapped genre IDs to genre names for better readability.\n",
    "- Extracted the `release_year` from `release_date` for better time-based analysis.\n",
    "- Cleaned up missing values and formatted columns for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "- Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to genre names to convert them into numerical format.\n",
    "- Scaled numerical features (`vote_average`, `popularity`, `release_year`) using **MinMaxScaler**.\n",
    "- Combined all features into a single feature matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling:**\n",
    "- Computed **Cosine Similarity** between movies based on the feature matrix.\n",
    "- Created a function `recommend_movies()` that:\n",
    "  - Accepts a movie title.\n",
    "  - Fetches the most similar movies using the similarity scores.\n",
    "  - Returns the top recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Interface (UI):**\n",
    "- Developed a simple and interactive UI using **Streamlit**:\n",
    "  - Dropdown list of African movies.\n",
    "  - Clickable button to fetch recommendations.\n",
    "  - Display of similar movies with details like title, genres, ratings, and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ **Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfully built and tested a **Content-Based Recommendation System** for **African movies**.\n",
    "- The Streamlit app allows users to effortlessly find similar movies from Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and more.\n",
    "- The model demonstrates real-time recommendations with high relevance based on genre and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîé **Next Steps**\n",
    "1. Extend the model to include **Collaborative Filtering** for user-based recommendations.\n",
    "2. Implement a **Hybrid Recommendation System** that merges content-based and collaborative methods.\n",
    "3. Deploy the model to a live web application for real-world testing and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
